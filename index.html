            <p>This is a typing test. Your goal is to duplicate the provided text, EXACTLY, in the field below. The timer starts when you start typing, and only stops when you match this text exactly. Good Luck!</p>

            <div id="origin-text">
                <p>this is a simple paragraph that is meant to be nice and easy to type which is why there will be commas no periods or any capital letters so i guess this means that it cannot really be considered a paragraph but just a series of run on sentences this should help you get faster at typing as im trying not to use too many difficult words in it although i think that i might start making it hard by including some more difficult letters I'm typing pretty quickly so forgive me for any mistakes i think that i will not just tell you a story about the time i went to the zoo and found a monkey and a fox playing together wait nevermind k bye</p>
